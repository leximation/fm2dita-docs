<title>Delete Extra Cross-Ref Markers</title>
<shortdesc>Scans for paragraphs that contain multiple Cross-Ref
markers and deletes all but one.</shortdesc>

<body><p><indexterm>broken cross-refs</indexterm><indexterm>cross-ref<indexterm>duplicate
markers</indexterm></indexterm>When FrameMaker generates a structured
document from unstructured content, it assigns an Id attribute to
any paragraph that contains a Cross-Ref marker. The value of the
Id attribute is based on the unique ID of that marker. If there
are multiple Cross-Ref markers in a paragraph, it chooses one and
ignores the others. If a cross-reference was linking to one of the
markers that isnâ€™t used to map the Id attribute, the resulting xref
will be broken.</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, this command scans the document for paragraphs
that contain multiple Cross-Ref markers. When this condition is
found, it deletes all but one of these markers from each paragraph.
Running this command will likely cause cross-references to become
unresolved, so it is important to re-run the Update Book command
after running this command, and resolve all unresolved references.</p>
<p>This command must be run before applying the conversion table.</p></body></topic>
