Application Developer’s Guide</indexterm>The fundamental concepts
of setting up a conversion table are fairly basic, but actually doing
so can be quite time consuming and complex. The best place to find
all of the details on this process is the <cite>Structure Application
Developer’s Guide</cite> from Adobe. Not much has changed over the
years on this subject, so you should be able to use most any version
of this document with any version of FrameMaker. With FM7.2, this
PDF was installed in the <filepath>OnlineManuals</filepath> folder,
for later versions you’ll have to locate it online. Just search
for the document title.</p>
<p>The FM2DITA preconversion commands are used before applying the
conversion table, but two commands, Retag Paras and Retag Tables
in Paras, will affect the way the conversion table is developed.
The FM2DITA sample files include a sample conversion table, we recommend
that you take a look at this conversion table, so you’ll be familiar
with a simple, but functional conversion table.</p></body></topic>
