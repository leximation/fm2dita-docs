<title>Typical Conversion Process</title>
<shortdesc>Each set of unstructured FrameMaker files will likely
have its own specific conversion requirements. The process described
here outlines the tasks in a typical conversion.</shortdesc>

<body><p><indexterm>conversion process, typical</indexterm>This
section breaks the conversion process into general tasks, and within
each task are steps that may apply to your conversion process.</p>
<p><i status = "new">Do not use this as an absolute guide.</i> Your
files may require additional processing or may not need everything
that is indicated. Additionally, each of the commands provided by
this plugin can be customized in many ways; be sure to read the
documentation carefully to ensure that youâ€™re getting the most from
the tool.</p>
<note type = "remember">It is important to fully understand the
conversion process and what each FM2DITA command is doing to your
files. Blindly running commands, will likely result in problems
that are hard to debug.</note>
<p status = "changed">When an FM2DITA command is used, it reads
default settings from the <filepath>fm2dita.ini</filepath> file.
The <filepath>fm2dita.ini</filepath> file is located by checking
the current directory (the directory with the file or book being
processed), then each parent directory. If this INI file is not
found, it reads from the default file in the <filepath>Pubs-Tools</filepath> folder
(use <menucascade><uicontrol>Pubs-Tools</uicontrol><uicontrol>Open
Pubs-Tools Folder</uicontrol></menucascade> to locate this folder).</p>
<note type = "tip">We encourage you to purchase the FrameSLT plugin
from West Street Consulting (<xref href = "http://weststreetconsulting.com/WSC_FrameSLT.htm"
format = "html" scope = "external">weststreetconsulting.com</xref>).
The NodeWizard feature in this plugin is invaluable for performing
various types of cleanup in the structured FM files.</note></body></topic>
