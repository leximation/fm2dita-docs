<title>Working with Qualifiers</title>
<shortdesc>For all but the simplest of conversions, you’ll need
to use qualifiers to properly identify and wrap like named elements
used in different structures.</shortdesc>

<body><p><indexterm>conversion table<indexterm>qualifiers</indexterm></indexterm>Qualifiers
are labels that are assigned to a mapping or wrapping rule to allow
you to distinguish the resulting element from other like-named elements
in later wrapping rules. Qualifiers can also be used to assign labels
to multiple different types of elements so you can refer to groups
of elements without naming each type in later wrapping rules. If
used, a qualifier label is included in the third column of a mapping
or wrapping rule.</p>
<p>There are no fixed rules about how to naming conventions for
qualifiers. As you develop conversion tables, you’ll likely come
up with your own naming conventions that make sense to you and work
best for your content. We’ll describe one method here, but the best method
is the one that “works.”</p>
<p>The best way to understand how qualifiers work is to review a
working conversion table. The FM2DITA sample files include a conversion
table that has been fully annotated (in the fourth column). We recommend
that you read through that file.</p>
