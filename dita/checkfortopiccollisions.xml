<title>Check for Topic Collisions</title>
<shortdesc>Provides a pre-write-to-XML scan of the current file
or book to ensure that the specified topic file naming scheme doesnâ€™t
result in any duplicate file names.</shortdesc>

<body><p><indexterm>topic file name collisions</indexterm><indexterm>file
name duplication</indexterm>Based on the settings in the <filepath>fm2dita.ini</filepath> file
that affect file naming, this command reports the number of files
that would result in duplication or overwriting of files. It is
important to run this before writing maps or topics, and should
be run before proceeding with a conversion. If file naming is based
on topic IDs, you will need to run the <cmdname conref = "_shared.xml#id131KC0I0VHS/cmd_assign-ids"></cmdname> command
before running this command. It is important to make sure that chapter numbering
properties are set properly in the book or file being processed
if the file naming relies on chapter numbering.</p>
<p>If file name collisions are reported, modify the TopicNameTpl
INI parameter or edit the topic titles (if file names are based
on topic titles). To ensure that file names do not collide, include
the $UNIQUEID building block in the topic name template. Also, including
the $FM_CHAPNUM building block can help to reduce the likelihood
of collisions (just remember to update the chapter numbering in
the book after importing the template and EDD).</p>
<p>This command must be run after the EDD has been applied.</p></body></topic>
