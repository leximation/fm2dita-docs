<body><p><indexterm>DITA topics<indexterm>from book or file</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>export
XML topics</indexterm>This command requires initial setup of the
TopicNameTpl parameter in the <filepath>fm2dita.ini</filepath> file as
well as any other settings or properties that affect file naming
(such as chapter numbering).</p>
<p>Each file is processed from the bottom, up. Each topic in the
file is selected, cut and copied to a new empty file, then saved
to XML. All files are written to the current file’s folder using the
structure application of the EDD that has been imported into the
current file.</p>
<note type = "important"><p>Before running this command, all FM
files should be validated using the <menucascade><uicontrol>Element</uicontrol>
<uicontrol>Validate</uicontrol></menucascade> command, for details
see <xref href = "task4preexportvalidation.xml#id137JH4004QN" type
= "task" format = "dita" scope = "local"></xref>.</p><p>If you’re
using DITA-FMx, you should disable all “auto-prolog” options before
running this command.</p><p>When processing is complete, any files
left open indicate that something went wrong with the processing
of that file. Note any content that remains in the file, but close
it without saving (or save it to a new name).</p></note>
<p>This command must be run after the EDD has been applied.</p></body></topic>
