<title>Task 5: Export Maps and Topics</title>

to XML</indexterm><indexterm>DITA topics<indexterm>creating</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>DITA
map<indexterm>creating</indexterm></indexterm>The export process
used by the <uicontrol status = "new">Write XML Topics</uicontrol> command,
relies on the structured application imported into the files (as
a template and EDD) in Task 3. In particular, the read/write rules
and export API client associated with the structured application
will control how elements are mapped and converted to XML. If you’re using
a structure application other than the FM2DITA app, you should do
some testing to make sure the elements will export properly to XML.
This can be done by just using a <uicontrol status = "new">Save
As XML</uicontrol> command, then checking the resulting XML file
for errors.</p></context>

an estimate of time based on the number of topics (this may not
be terribly accurate).</li>
<li>Before writing XML topics form the file, it is saved, then after
processing it is closed without saving. This allows you to go back
and re-write XML files later if needed.</li>
<li>If any files remain open, it’s likely that there was a problem
and the process stopped mid-book. Review the open files and check
for errors in the console.</li></ul></info></step>

either need to manually add references to these reltable maps or
copy/paste the reltables into the root or chapter maps.</p></postreq></taskbody></task>
