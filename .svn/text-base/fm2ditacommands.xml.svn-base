<body><p><indexterm>commands, listed</indexterm>Most of the FM2DITA
commands can be run on a book or file. If a command is only available
for one or the other, that is indicated in the title.</p>
<p>These commands appear in the FM2DITA menu in the general order
they should be run. Not all commands are needed for all conversions,
but in most cases you should not run a command listed later on the
menu before one listed higher on the menu.</p>
<p>When run on a book file, if a referenced document is not open,
it is opened, processed and saved; referenced documents that are
open, are processed but not saved. In general, it is best to run
these commands on documents that are open, so you can review any
errors before saving the document.</p></body></topic>
