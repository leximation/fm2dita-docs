<body><p><indexterm>installation<indexterm>sample files</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>sample
files</indexterm>FM2DITA installs a file named <filepath>FM2DITA_samples.zip</filepath>,
which contains a structure application and sample FrameMaker content
that can be used for testing and review. This ZIP file will be installed
to the <filepath>FrameMaker\Pubs-Tools</filepath> folder.</p>
<p>Copy this file to a location on your system and extract the contents.
After extraction, you’ll see a folder named <filepath>fm2dita-samples</filepath> that
contains three folders, <filepath>source</filepath>, <filepath>images</filepath>,
and <filepath>out</filepath>. It also contains a file named <filepath>f2d-conv-table.fm</filepath> (this
is the sample conversion table).</p>
<p>The conversion table is set up to convert the sample unstructured
FM files to structured files, and it contains notes that explain
each row in the table.</p>
<p>All of the FM files are saved as version 7.2 files, so if you’re
opening them on a later version of FrameMaker, you may want to open
them all and save them so they are saved as the proper version to
avoid needless messages.</p>
<p>If you’re using a Trial version of FM2DITA, you’ll want to remove
two of the files from the book, since the Trial version doesn’t
allow processing of more than 3 files (you’ll get a message each
time you try to process a book with more than 3 files).</p>
<p>To run the full conversion on the sample files, you can follow
the guidelines in <xref href = "typicalconversionprocess.xml#id137JG0HN0Y4"
type = "topic" format = "dita" scope = "local"></xref>. In Task
3, where you run specific FM2DITA commands, you only need to use
the following commands (the provided <filepath>fm2dita.ini</filepath> file
is set up as needed for these commands).</p>
<ul><li><uicontrol>Assign IDs to Topics in Book</uicontrol></li>
<li><uicontrol>Fix Images in Book</uicontrol></li>
