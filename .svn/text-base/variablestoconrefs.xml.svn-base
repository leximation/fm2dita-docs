<title>Variables to Conrefs</title>
<shortdesc>Creates conrefs from FM variables in the current file
or book.</shortdesc>

<body><p><indexterm>variables, to conrefs</indexterm><indexterm>conref,
conversion from variables</indexterm>This command requires initial
setup of the ConrefLibrary parameter in the <filepath>fm2dita.ini</filepath> file. Set
the ConrefLibrary parameter to the name of the conref library file
to be created or appended. This file is created in the same folder
as the generated XML files.</p>
<p>When converting documents that contain variables, your conversion
table must use the “UV:&lt;varname>” syntax in order to map the
variables to a specific element. In order to be processed by this
command, the mapped element must assign the attribute “conrefid” with
the value being that to be used as the ID of the conref. The conversion
table entry for a “ProdName” variable would be as follows:</p>
<table frame = "all" colsep = "1" rowsep = "1">
<tgroup cols = "3" colsep = "1" rowsep = "1" outputclass = "FormatA">
<colspec colnum = "1" colname = "1" colwidth = "33*"/>
<colspec colnum = "2" colname = "2" colwidth = "33*"/>
<colspec colnum = "3" colname = "3" colwidth = "33*"/>
<thead>
<row rowsep = "1">
<entry colname = "1">Wrap this object</entry>
<entry colname = "2">In this element</entry>
<entry colname = "3">With this qualifier</entry>
</row>
</thead>
<tbody>
<row rowsep = "0">
<entry colname = "1">UV:ProdName</entry>
<entry colname = "2">ph[conrefid=”prodname”]</entry>
<entry colname = "3"></entry>
</row>
</tbody>
</tgroup></table>
<p>After applying the conversion table, the variable would be wrapped
in a &lt;ph> element with the attribute @conrefid=’prodname’. Once
this command has been run, the @conrefid attribute will be replaced
with the proper @conref attribute that references the element in the
conref library file.</p>
<p>The conref library file is created if it doesn’t already exist,
then it is appended with a new entry for each variable definition
(instance of a unique @conrefid in the source file). The conref
source is created using a &lt;p> tag container with a label that
matches the @conrefid value followed by the inline element matching
the element used by the variable. The ID attribute matches that
of the @conrefid attribute. Each entry will follow this format:</p>
<codeblock>&lt;p>prodname: &lt;ph id="prodname">DITA-FMx&lt;/ph>&lt;/p></codeblock>
<p>This command must be run after the EDD has been applied.</p></body></topic>
