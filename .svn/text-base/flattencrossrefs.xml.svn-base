<title>Flatten Cross-refs</title>
<shortdesc status = "changed">Removes link text from cross-ref objects
in the current file or book in preparation for export to XML.</shortdesc>

<body status = "changed"><p status = "changed">When saving to XML,
the content of a cross-ref object is “popped out” of the container
element. This is not useful and results in duplication of the link
text (the xref resolves and pulls in the target text, and the “popped”
text follows the xref element. This command prevents this from happening.</p>
<p status = "new">Note that after running this command you will
not see any cross-ref text in your file. This is as expected. You
will see the xref elements, and they will properly resolve after
export to XML.</p>
<p status = "new">If you are not using the Related Links to Reltable
command and would prefer that the Fix Cross-refs command did the
flattening as well, set the General/FlattenXrefs parameter to “1”.</p>
<p status = "changed">This command must be run after the <cmdname
conref = "_shared.xml#id131KC0I0VHS/cmd_fix-xrefs" status = "changed"></cmdname> command
has been run.</p></body></topic>
